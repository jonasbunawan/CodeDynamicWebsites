											Our client was a online sole hardware trader, Better Hardware Pty. Ltd., which is owned by Mr. Tim Wilson.
											Luckily enough, we interacted with the owner himself, so there was not too much hasles, to build our project solution for about 3-4 months (August - November) where we basically re-built his company website, which is based on Magento e-Commerce, to be mobile friendly as well as increase website popularity by proposing some SEO solutions.
											Finally, our solution has been brought to live since early 2016 by his development team.",
