		<h1>Jonas Bunawan's Fun Facts :)</h1>
		<p>I am a geeky kind of guy who just recently finished his Bachelor Degree Studies with major of Information and Communication Technology - Business Systems at Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Australia.
		My current interests in Technology are Programming and Database as well as Web Development which I study myself. I am also into music and do some covers on my own (Check out my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jonas-bunawan">soundcloud account</a>) :)
		So, <a href="contact.php">hit me up</a> if you feel that we are going to the same direction! Adios, Amigos!</p>
